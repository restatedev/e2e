# Steps

First, get all dependencies and build tools:
```
npm install
```

Next, adjust the 'proto' definitions. Then run:
```
npm run proto
```

Finally, implement your code.
Use `npm run app-dev` to start in dev mode (watch for changes and reload automatically).

To properly build/run the code, do
```
npm run build
npm run app
```
